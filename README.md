Keen IO iOS SDK
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keenlabs/KeenClient-iOS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/keenlabs/KeenClient-iOS)

The Keen IO iOS client is designed to be simple to develop with, yet incredibly flexible. Our goal is to let you decide what events are important to you, use your own vocabulary to describe them, and decide when you want to send them to Keen IO.

[Client Documentation](https://keen.io/docs/clients/iOS/usage-guide)

### Installation

Use [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install! Just add a line to your Podfile like so:
```
    pod 'KeenClient'
```

Then run

```objc
    pod install
```

##### Build Settings

Make sure to add CoreLocation.framework to the "Link Binary with Libraries" section.

Also enable the "-ObjC" linker flag under "Other Linker Flags".

Voila!

For other methods, see our detailed documentation [here](https://keen.io/docs/clients/iOS/usage-guide).

### Usage

To use this client with the Keen IO API, you have to configure your Keen IO Project ID and its access keys (if you need an account, [sign up here](https://keen.io/) - it's free).

##### Register Your Project ID and Access Keys

```objc
    - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
    {
        [KeenClient sharedClientWithProjectId:@"your_project_id" andWriteKey:@"your_write_key" andReadKey:@"your_read_key"];
    }
```

The write key is required to send events to Keen IO. The read key is required to do analysis on Keen IO.

##### Add Events

Use the client like so:

```objc
    - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
    {
        [super viewWillAppear:animated];

        NSDictionary *event = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:@"first view", @"view_name",
                               @"going to", @"action", nil];
        [[KeenClient sharedClient] addEvent:event toEventCollection:@"tab_views" error:nil];
    }
```

##### Upload Events to Keen IO

Adding events just stores the events locally on the device. You must explicitly upload them to Keen IO. Here's an example:

```objc
    - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application
    {
        UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier taskId = [application beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:^(void) {
            NSLog(@"Background task is being expired.");
        }];

        [[KeenClient sharedClient] uploadWithFinishedBlock:^(void) {
            [application endBackgroundTask:taskId];
        }];
    }
```
    
That's it! After running your code, check your Keen IO Project to see the event has been added.

An important note: it's a best practice to issue a single upload at a time. We make a best effort to reduce the number of threads spawned to upload in the background, but if you call upload many many times in a tight loop you're going to cause issues for yourself.

##### Do analysis with Keen IO

##### Tracking events in OS X apps

This SDK *should* work for OS X apps. If you try and it doesn't work, please file an issue here. Thanks!
    
### Changelog

##### 3.2.13
